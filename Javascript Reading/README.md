# Hi Rachel I hope you're doing good!
## Lilith Santos - Javascript Reading Assignment
### p.s i really enjoy this [picture of this dog](https://x.com/dokibird/status/1764862264497352916)

## Values, Types, and Operators
### I knew about number values in javascript being limited to numeric values. But not only that, but the bigger / smaller the number gets, decimal points and scientific notation must be used.
### I didn't know that strings couldn't have any sort of mathematical effect on it, which means we cannot divide, multiply or subtract. Instead, we can concatenate which means to glue the strings together using a + sign.

## Program Structure
### I definitely knew a lot about bindings and functions. I remember talking to ChatGPT about something like that before when I was a bit more inexperienced using javascript for a website I later threw out.
### Something that I wasn't to hip to was the idea of while and do loops, a lot of those numbers and the statement "while" is a little bit lost / new to me. 

## Functions
### I didn't know anything about nested scopes! I have no sense of locatlity, which kind of reminds me of the "spaghetti" code that lies within my RenPy repository (psa, I know that these two languages are fundamentally different -- just acknowledging that).
### I already knew a bit about optional arguments! Definitely arrow functions too, I enjoy putting the little carrot after the = sign, and enjoy putting them after a list of parameters.
