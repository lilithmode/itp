## Wow. That wasn't too bad. 
### I  just used the code along doc, tried out some newer things, and after some cross referencing with some friends of mine online, ended up with a not-too-shabby FizzBuzz. I'm a bit tired as it is 4 am.

### I hope you're doing good Rachel. Here's a cool [video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFmxPMdBqmU&ab_channel=AlanBecker) I understood some of these words! :D

`    for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
        console.log("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
        console.log("Fizz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
        console.log("Buzz");
    } else {
        console.log(i);
    }
} `
