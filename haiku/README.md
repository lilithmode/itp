# Come Back To Me - Lilith

## *How are you still here?*

### Your love still travels through life.

### **You were always here.**

###### above is the haiku that I decided to write! I thought this assignment would be a bit more nuanced but I'm really glad I paid attention in class. I used to write a lot of poetry back in early high school so making a haiku felt a lot more natural in my workflow rather than finding one. 

###### I then proceeded to just use the terminal, have the "say" command do it's thing and made a file named lilithhaiku.aiff to make it easier to find in my drive. For context I don't know how to change my deadname on my MBP so I replaced it with the word deadname for more context. It wasn't that hard to find the aiff file after having the hard drive available and so easy to access. Below is the command I ran and I hope you enjoyed it <3
