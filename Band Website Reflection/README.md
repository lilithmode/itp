# [Band Website](https://lilithmode.github.io/) Creation with Group!
## we love massimo, anda, hana and me :3

### let's talk about the problems we faced. at first it was with github and getting everyone's repository working. at the end of the day we ended up bouncing a lot of the files via airdrop while me and massimo took charge at the actual pushing and fetching of said files. in terms of other decisions made, we figured it would be easier to give everyone a certain task / part of the website in order to divvy and attack the website from different angles. this proved to be helpful in the end because we ended up communicating a lot of the time and managed to get all the requirements done, even with some roadbumps (i.e, style sheets and more) before the time limit.

### i think i did a decent job at coordinating. it was a bit of a tough ask for me but i wanted to make sure that everyone had a decent hand in implementing different features. i ended up making the organization, the paragraphs, and implemented the very basic structure of the site. without the help of my team mates, i wouldn't have been able to finish up the website and organize it in the way that we would all be proud of.

#### massimo did amazing, managed to figure out the background images, did his own bio, and saved the day with the hyper link.

#### anda did a great job locking in on his bio, but more importantly successfully implemented the mp3 file that i had made for the band.

#### hana did an amazing job with finding out how to implement gifs, structuring the body for the html, and overall was a great manager (whether it was intentional or unintentional)
