### i didn't really do that much, it was pretty simple to follow the tutorial and crossreference the writings / book when i needed to.
### i ended up debugging on google chrome because i didn't know how to run it on textmate (LOLLLLL) so i might ask you about that when we're in class tomorrow
### couldn't figure out why it didn't work until it hit me halfway through - THE BACKTICKS. so i immediately went back and changed it hahaha

#### thank you <3 

`old code
let f = 99;let c = (f-32) * 5 / 9;console.log('${f} Farenheit is converted to ${c} Celsius')`

#### do you see my plight now

`new code 
let f = 99;let c = (f-32) * 5 / 9;console.log(`${f} Farenheit is converted to ${c} Celsius`)`
