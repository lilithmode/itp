# PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU.

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I think I'm gonna name the game "PLEASE I'M BEGGING YOU." It's gonna be encapsulating a lot of the yearning that I hope to achieve when developing this little game of mine.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

My project will be a twine engine game that goes through dialogue and a character study on two different people in a relationship. It will be akin to a visual novel.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

One of the resources I will use for this project are my two friends Wen and Monique. They have a good background in similar languages so being able to consult with them would be a fun experiment and a good second / third brain to bounce ideas off of. [monique's work here](https://falseaxiom.github.io/)

Another resource that I've downloaded is the Twine cookbook. Just being able to read and do some codealongs for features i want to implement would be beneficial for my development cycle. Even if I don't finish it in time, I'll have the knowledge to really lock in the ideas I want to come across and proceed even further.[twine cookbook here](https://twinery.org/cookbook/)

A third resource I would use is probably a lot of the forum posts and a mixture of chatGPT. I'll document anything I do with GPT, but besides that I think I could trust the community a bit more when it comes to certain things like audio implementation and other things like password gimmicks.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

excerpt from my game design document:

"you are playing as a mess of a protagonist (probably non binary lmfao), as you try to get your partner back the dialogue choices get harder to choose as they’re absolute fucking bullshit halfway through. meant to be a bit comedic, but there are opportunities to keep the partner around. you are tasked to try to find all the trees and different endings within the time limit for each “run” and would later find dumb gimmicks throughout in order to get more work done in the relationship.

in terms of visual style, it'll have classic twine look, but i would like to focus a lot on technical art. i’m talking about languages being translated live and the voice actors’ native language being turned into english halfway through. think of a surrealist story but as a text based game, and we can be a bit relentless on the type of world we’re building. absolute nonsense becoming incarnate and consistent.

objectives: you go through dialogue and learn more about actions that you can do. it’s super fast, but if you pay attention enough you can actually mess up and end up in the right place. it’s super dependent on how good the writing can be but i think it can be fun to explore like 3-4 different endings. the “rougelite” aspect of this story (just restarting and looking for a different run) at the end of every death or run you learn more about their relationship and how it got to this point.

game systems: essentially the player will be interacting with the dialogue choices. as this is mostly a character study it’ll be implied that the sometimes the decisions will not turn out to come out the way they expected to. 

i want the demo to be fully voice acted by a couple of different voice actors

in terms of long term goals, i want to make the story as interactive as possible.

sometimes there will be pop ups and questionnaires that might be able to give results later, kinda like catherine (the game)? we can also make it a bit funnier.

another example of a mini game that can happen is guessing a password that can pop up in dialogue.

and one more is something where you have to keyboard smash in order to send a text / get through to something. i'll find a way to make it narrative sense.

last fun idea would be making fun of captchas, where you’re about to send an important text but you gotta keyboard smash, and then you end up sending that text instead. or you have to guess what numbers are shown to you. or that dumb 'find the boxes with the firetruck' in it"

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

I can totally see this overlapping with a possible 401 final project with Lee Gilboa. I have to ask her if it's okay to do this, but I also want to push it further than just the classes and release this work alongside a team I want to work with to make this a fun, and simple game. Maybe a demo would suffice!

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to have a playable demo that goes through the very fundamentals of the game mechanics. Playing the game, seeing an ending, trying again. The game mechanics would be just going through the narrative and listening, akin to a visual novel.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to have the technical art locked in. I would love to see how much I could do with the dialogue, voice actors, and live translation of these things within the dialogue.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To have a full playable demo with some of the features, and have a couple of endings! But realistically probably only one ending would be a fun thing to explore.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

To start, I will need to learn more about the twine engine and how it works, especially with a team. Thankfully I wont be alone as I'll have the help of Wen Chew and my other friend Monique who offered to volunteer their work towards this cause. For the first week I'll be finishing up a simple script and seeing a line of a story the entire way through. For the second week I'm looking to start coding and seeing how much I can get done regarding framework and how much I can write down within each of the nodes. For the third week, I'm planning on probably having all of the voice lines (for this part at least) finished and hopefully plan on implementing. Week four will be all related to technical art and seeing what kind of presentation I'll be able to have in order to properly "pitch" this game for the class. I think I need to brush up on the coding language by then and run it through until the end!
